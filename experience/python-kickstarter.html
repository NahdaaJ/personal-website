            <p class="experience-description">I completed the Code First Girls Python Kickstarter 
                course, where I was introduced to core programming concepts such as variables, 
                functions, and general Python fundamentals. As part of the final project, I 
                collaborated with a teammate to apply what we had learned, and successfully earned 
                a certificate upon completion.</p>
            <p class="experience-highlight"> Our project received a distinction and was recognised as one of the strongest in the group.</p>
