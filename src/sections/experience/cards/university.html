            <p class="experience-description">I studied Mechatronic and Robotic Engineering (BEng) at the University 
                of Sheffield, where I developed a solid foundation in electronics, control systems, embedded computing, 
                and intelligent systems, underpinned by strong fundamentals in mathematics and physics. The course 
                balanced theory with practical application, including 3D modelling and simulation work.</p>
