**Hey there! ãƒ¾(ï¼¾âˆ‡ï¼¾)** Welcome to my WIP personal portfolio. I'm a junior software developer delving into the world of web dev for fun! This project is my playground, where I experiment, learn, and showcase my skills.

## Project Goals

ðŸŒ¸ **Learn and Grow:** - This project is about continuous learning and improvement! I'm constantly challenging myself to explore new technologies and techniques.
<br/>
ðŸŒ¸ **Showcase Skills** - I aim to demonstrate my abilities as a web developer through this portfolio!
<br/>
ðŸŒ¸ **Have Fun!** - The real aim of this project is to have a good time! I love mixing programming and creativity together!

## What's Inside?
- [`index.html`](index.html): The main HTML file for the website, including all the sections and navigation bar!
- [`styles/`](styles/): The main CSS file for styling the website.
  -  [`styles/base/`](styles/base/): In this directory, I store important variables and styling that is used throughout every component.
  -  [`styles/components/`](styles/components/): This folder stores all the components separately, such as each section and the navigation.
  -  [`styles/responsive/`](styles/responsive/): All the CSS files that correspond to different screen sizes are found here.
- [`scripts/index.js`](scripts/index.js): The main JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the website.
- [`images/`](images/): Directory containing images used in the website, some of which were drawn by me!
- [`icons/`](icons/): Directory containing icons used in the website.

## Current Progress

This project is a work in progress! I have no set deadline for when I aim to finish this project, and will be taking it at my own pace!! Even after "finishing", I will be maintaining and updating the site with better/cooler features! â™¡( â€¢à¥¢â—¡-à¥¢)âœ§Ë–Â° â™¡

I have just finished adding responsiveness and also structured my folder structure in a more organised manner. I split my CSS into different files depending on the functionality, which will make adding to and maintaining the website much easier in the future! 

Creating the `About Me` section is next on the agenda!
